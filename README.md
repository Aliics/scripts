# scripts

Small scripts for my own convenience; sometimes automated stuff is just so
much easier to live with.

# setup

Clone this repository locally.
> git clone https://github.com/Aliics/scripts.git

Change directory to **$HOME**
> cd $HOME

Create a symbolic link to this directory
> ln -s WHERE_REPO_IS_LOCATED ./scripts

After having the directory with all the scripts cloned into a convenient place
under home, it could be useful to have these scripts aliased in your 
**.bashrc**.
