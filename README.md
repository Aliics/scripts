# scripts

This is just a small repository to house my convenience scripts.
I would normally just put all of these in a gist, but it's not as
version control-y.

All scripts in this repo are to be as OS independent as possible 
_(with the exception of Windows)_. In saying that, if this is just
simply not possible, then a little comment shall be placed at the
head of the script specifying the systems it either can or cannot be
run on.
