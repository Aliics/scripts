# scripts

This is just a small repository to house my convenience scripts.
I would normally just put all of these in a gist, but it's not as
version control-y.

# current scripts

script | description
-- | --
[display_config.sh](display_config.sh) | Configures my displays for all setups that I have.
[cp_branch.sh](cp_branch.sh) | Copies currently checked out branch to clipboard.
[touch_bash.sh](touch_bash.sh) | Wraps touch to create bash scripts.
